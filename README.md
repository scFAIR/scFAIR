# scFAIR: an initiative to standardize single-cell genomics data and promote findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable single-cell data.

This repo contains open metadata schemas for single cell data extending the existing CZI schemas.

You can access [our portal](https://sc-fair.org/) to browse datasets that are compatible with our schemas.
